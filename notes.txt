separate nouns from the rest of the sentence
nouns are in a file called general.txt
the rest of the sentence is in a file called templ

The bot relies on 2 text files for processing sentences One file contains nouns and some info about them. The another file cont some common sent without the nouns with info about the purpose of the sentence and what functions should deal with it
the functions tend to focus on the verb in the sentence an whether the sent is a statement, q or command.
with statements info is stored, with questions the info is retrieved

example:
bob types "i am tired"
the matching template is found
   * is *, handle_attribute_statement,1, 3
it determined that bob has typed a statement that assins an atribute(the 3rd word) to himself(the first word)
the following entry is added to the database. It contains Bobs ID, the type of attribute and his current state:
   #2 > state: tired
Some other time the bot can ask Bob "how are you, still tired"
